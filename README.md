# PictureConverter
Simple Picture Converter in C#

## How to use
Download the latest release on the [release page](https://github.com/Marly212/PictureConverter/releases) and extract it in your folder.

Then that just double click the .exe file and the GUI should show up.

After that its pretty much self explaining how it works. Simple select a folder or a file with the buttons and press start. 

When the program finished converting the pictures, a PoP-up should show.
